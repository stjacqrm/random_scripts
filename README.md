# random_scripts

Just some short scripts that I made to solve the world's smallest bioinformatics problems.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to run the scripts

```
python3+
```

### Installing

The world's easiest install can be done using git clone, and setting to path

```
$ git clone https://github.com/stjacqrm/random_scripts.git
```

## Current scripts

Currently, there's just the one.

```
changerator.py
```
Changerator is there for you when you've used a genome assembler that creates a directory with a contigs.fa file, but you would REALLY like for that file to be name {name_of_your_directory}.fasta and moved to a better directory.
